# MiSTer_NN

Unofficial builds of popular MiSTer cores built using Nearest Neighbor scaling for HDMI.

All core licenses and original cores can be viewed at the official project page:
https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki

The goal of these unofficial cores is to enable the Nearest Neighbor scaling method, which tends to produce a sharper image with pixel graphics than Polyphase or Bicubic which is used in the official cores.

## Some known issues: ##

*   At lower HDMI resolutions, text may appear uneven/distorted.
*   There may be shimmering, most noticeable at lower resolutions
*   "Advanced" scaler options (Hq2x, CRT) may have visual artifacts
*   There may be other unintended visual issues. If this is the case, use the official core for your setup.


## Notes ##
I consider this a stop-gap solution to satisfy more demanding users as the scaling matures in the main project. These should be considered unstable test builds for enthusiasts, and in time I hope an equivalent or better solution for a clear HDMI scaler becomes available without special builds.
