# MiSTer_NN

Builds of popular MiSTer cores built using Nearest Neighbor scaling for HDMI.

All core licenses and original cores can be viewed at the official project page:
[id]: https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki "MiSTer Project"

The goal of these cores is to represent the official core builds accurate, while using the Nearest Neigbor scaling method, which tends to produce a sharper image with pixel graphics than Polyphase or Bicubic.

## Some known issues: ##

*   At lower HDMI resolutions, text may appear uneven/distorted.
*   There may be shimmering, most noticeable at lower resolutions
*   "Advanced" scaler options (Hq2x, CRT) may have visual artifacts
*   There may be other unintended visual issues. If this is the case, use the official core for your setup.
